# UsernameBot

A bot I made to remove those pesky low value ASCII characters in front of my peers' names on discord.


The bot automatically detects and updates usernames when they are changed, but will not run on the initial usernames upon joining. 
Use `!banish` once the bot joins to manually banish unsightly usernames to the bottom of the user list.
